tfa.dump.* are binary dumps of the whole EEPROM.
"decode_tfa" is a tool to interpret these dump files, and write the 
measurement data to stdout.

The binary dumps are dumped every half hour, using cron + dump_tfa.

Measurements may wrap around in the middle of the file, this needs to 
be checked by the caller (decode_tfa does not take care of this, but tries
to be helpful and emits "I: WRAPAROUND\n" to stdout if this happens).



Example usage of decode_tfa:

$ ../klimalogger/decode_tfa tfa.dump.20080131.1500 > plain.20080131.1500
Found 5 external sensors.
 ==== 6 total sensors.

Record field description:

- Field 1: record counter
- Field 2: date of measurement
- Field 3: time of measurement (localtime)

After these three, the optional fields start. Each field is written in this 
format: " $TYPE$SENSOR: $VALUE", where:
- TYPE: can be "T" or "H", for temperature or humidity
- SENSOR: one of "in", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5". "in" = "inside", the others are "outside"
- VALUE: the value of this field. for temperatues: in degrees Celsius, for humidity: in percent

Every record is terminated by a line-feed character ("\n")
