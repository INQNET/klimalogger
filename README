With open3600 you can read and later write to and from a WS-3600 weather station.
You do anything - maybe even harm the station or bring it into a mode it
never comes out of again.
It is your choice if you want to take the risk.
The author takes no responsibility for any damage the use of this program
may cause.


dump3600
Is a special tool which will dump a range of memory into a file
AND to the screen. This makes is possible to easily see what has changed in
an area larger than 15 bytes and even use a file comparison tool to spot the
changes. Note that the WS-3600 operates with addresses of 4-bit nibbles.
When you specify an odd number of addresses the program will always add one
as it always fetches bytes from the station and displays these bytes.
If you only want a file and no display output just run it as:
dump3600 filename start end > /dev/null
If you only want to display and not create a file run:
dump3600 /dev/null start end


bin3600 
Does the same as dump3600 except the data is written in binary
format to the file. It is not byte for byte. Each nibble from the station
is saved as one byte in the file (always value from 00 to 0F).
The advantage of this is that when you look with a binary file viewer and
you started from address 0 the addresses fit 1:1.


history3600
Read out a selected range of the history records as raw data to
both screen and file. Output is human readable.


log3600
It reads all the current data from the station
and append the data to a log file with a time stamp. The file format is
human readable text but without any labels - only with single space between
each value and a newline for each record. This makes it easy to pick up the
data using e.g. Perl or PHP for presentation on the web.


fetch3600
This software reads all current values from the  
station incl min/max data and dates and output them in a simple format to
standard out. The idea is that you can call this program from a Perl or PHP
page and load the data in an array ready for display.
To load the data into php place this example code in the page.

<?php
exec("/usr/local/bin/fetch3600",$fetcharray);
foreach ($fetcharray as $value)
{
	list($parameter,$parvalue)=explode(" ", $value);
	$ws["$parameter"]=$parvalue;
}
?>

You can let the rest be pure HTML and just put in for example
<?=$ws["To"]?> to show outdoor temperature.


wu3600  1.0. This is a development of fetch3600 which only fetches
the data used by Weather Underground (http://www.wunderground.com) and it
uploads your data to your personal weather station page at Weather Underground.
For this to work you need to register your station at Weather Underground.
You will then receive an ID and a password. This ID and password must be added
to the config file (open3600.conf) before the program is used.


cw3600
This again is a version of fetch3600 which fetched
current data from the weather station and sends it to the Citizen Weather
Observation Program via the APRSWXNET (Automatic Positioning Reporting System
Weather Network) but using one of the Internet APRS servers.
I received the original version from Randy Miller (radio ham N6ABM).
It was fully working and a great piece of work.
I had to completely rewrite it to fit my new library rw3600 and to make
it compatible with Windows.

xml3600
It is another example of work derived from fetch3600.
Again it collects data from the weather station and stores the data in an XML file.
It is very easy to modify the source to any XML coding you like.


mysql3600
It works like log3600 but instead of writing to a flat file it stores the
weather data in a MySQL database.
The program requires that MySQL client library and header files are installed.
At the release of I had not yet built a version on Windows. But with the
right MySQL things installed and some tweaks in the Makefile it should
compile also on Windows.

pgsql3600
It works like log3600 but instead of writing to a flat file it stores the
weather data in a PostgresSQL database.
The program requires that PostgresSQL client library and header files are installed.
This is only available for Linux for the moment.

light3600.c  
It is a small tool that can turn the LCD backlight on and off


histlog3600.c  
It does a similar job to log3600.c but instead of reading the current data
it read the history data stored in the weather station. Windchill and dewpoint
are calculated values based on the other measurements.
It checks the log file for the last record written and read all the new
records and add them to the log file.


interval3600.c  
This is a small tool set can set and read the interval at which the weather
station saves the history datasets.


minmax3600.c  
It is a new tool using the new rw3600 reset functions to reset min/max for
all measurements and resetting rain counters.


rw3600.c / rw3600.h
This is the common function library. This has been extended in so that
now you can read actual weather data using these functions without having
to think about decoding the data from the weather station.

linux3600.c / linux3600.h
This is part of the common function library and contains all the platform
unique functions. These files contains the functions that are special for
Linux. It contains re-written code from the 1.1 version of rw3600.

win3600.c / win3600.h
This is part of the common function library and contains all the platform
unique functions. These files contains the functions that are special for
Windows. The most important new part is the code that handles the serial port.
As long as a windows C compiler defines a variable called WIN32 the compiler
will choose to the win3600.c and .h files when compiling.
We have used the MingW32 compiler on Windows. This is a free open source
compiler that uses the gcc compiler and makefiles.
The Windows programs have been tested on Windows XP.

memory_map_3600.txt is a very useful information file that tells all the
currently known positions of data inside the weather station.
The information in this file may not be accurate. It is gathered by Sander & Grzegorz
http://open3600.fast-mail.nl/tiki-view_forum.php?forumId=8
by hours of experiments. None of the information has come from the
manufacturer of the station. If you find something new please send email
to the author (email address below).
Using the memory map and the rw3600 library is it pretty easy to create
your own Linux driven interface for your weather station.


Installing:

Read the file INSTALL.



How to use the programs:
All the programs now uses a config file to get information like
COM port (serial device name), preferred units of dimentions,
etc etc.
See the INSTALL file and the open3600.conf-dist file for more info.
Note that you should copy the open3600.conf-dist to your preferred location
and that it should be renamed to open3600.conf.

open3600
Read bytes:    open3600 address_hex r number_of_bytes
Write nibbles: open3600 address_hex w text_hex_string
Set bits:      open3600 address_hex s bit_number
Unset bits:    open3600 address_hex c bit_number

dump3600
Write address to file:	dump3600 filename start_address end_address
The addresses are simply written in hex. E.g. 21C 3A1

bin3600
Write address to file:	bin3600 filename start_address end_address
The addresses are simply written in hex. E.g. 21C 3A1

history3600
Write records to file:	history3600 filename start_record end_record
The addresses are simply written in hex. E.g. 1B 3A

log3600
Write current data to log interpreted: log3600 filename config_filename
This is very suitable for a cron job since it makes no output to screen.
If no config_filename is given the program will search for it using the
default search sequence - see the open3600.conf-dist file.

fetch3600
Write current data to standard out: fetch3600 config_filename
It takes one parameter which is the config file name with path.
If this parameter is omitted the program will look at the default paths.

wu3600
Send current data to Weather Underground: wu3600 config_filename
It takes one parameter which is the config file name with path.
If this parameter is omitted the program will look at the default paths.

Remember to add your Weather Underground ID and password to the config file.
To get an account at Weather Underground - go here
http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/index.asp

cw3600
Send current data to CWOP: cw3600 config_filename
It takes one parameter which is the config file name with path.
If this parameter is omitted the program will look at the default paths.

To join the Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP) - go here
http://www.wxqa.com/
At the release of version  the 4 APRS servers given should be valid.
If they later change simply update the config file.
Without a config file two default servers are hard coded in the program.

xml3600
Write current data to XML file: xml3600 xml-filename config_filename
It takes two parameters. xml_file_path and config_filename.
If the config_filename parameter is omitted the program will look
at the default paths.

mysql3600
Write current data to MySQL database: mysql3600 config_filename
It takes one parameter which is the config file name with path.
If this parameter is omitted the program will look at the default paths.


pgsql3600
Write current data to PostgresSQL database: pgsql3600 config_filename
It takes one parameter which is the config file name with path.
If this parameter is omitted the program will look at the default paths.


light3600
Turn light off:    light3600 off config_filename
Turn light on:     light3600 on config_filename
If the config_filename parameter is omitted the program will look
at the default paths.

histlog3600
Write history data to log file interpreted.
histlog3600 log_filename config_filename
If the config_filename parameter is omitted the program will look
at the default paths.

interval3600
Read or set the time interval at which the weatherstation saves the
history data.
Set Interval: light3600 interval_minutes next_dataset_minutes config_filename.
Read current Interval: light3600 0 0 config_filename\n".
If interval is set to 0 the current setting is displayed but nothing changed.
If the config_filename parameter is omitted the program will look
at the default paths.

minmax3600
Reset minimum/maximum values in a WS-3600 weather station.
Reset Daily Maximum (Temp, Humid, WC, DP): minmax3600 dailymax config_filename
Reset Daily Minimum (Temp, Humid, WC, DP): minmax3600 dailymin config_filename
Reset Temperature Indoor Max|Min|Both: minmax3600 timax|timin|tiboth config_filename

Reset Rain Counter 1h|24h|Total: minmax3600 r1|r24|rtotal config_filename
If the config_filename parameter is omitted the program will look
at the default paths.


weatherstation.php
It contains a simple PHP webpage that will fetch the current weather data
directly from your station and show it on a nice webpage.
It will run on any webserver running PHP. Just copy the files to any
directory in the web tree. The png and jpg files are small graphics
used on the webpage to show forecast and tendency.
